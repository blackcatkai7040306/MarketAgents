# Interactive Memory and Market Dashboard

## WIP

The Interactive Agent Memory Dashboard is a web application designed to analyze data from our agents performing in a simulated market. It combines memory management techniques with data visualization to provide insights into AI agent behaviors within a simulated economic environment.

## Key Features

1. **Memory Search and Visualization**
   - Semantic search functionality for querying AI agent memories
   - Visualization of memory embeddings
   - Display of search results with similarity scores

2. **Agent Data Analysis**
   - Visualization of various agent metrics and trends

3. **AI Memory Management**
   - Implementation of a memory management system for AI applications
   - Simulates memory processes including storage, retrieval, and decay

4. **Interactive User Interface**
   - Web-based dashboard for data exploration and analysis

## Technology Stack

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Data Visualization: Plotly.js
- Memory Module: Custom implementations for memory management and embeddings

## Integration with Larger Project

This dashboard serves as a component in the broader AI market simulation framework, providing tools for analyzing agent behaviors and market dynamics.
